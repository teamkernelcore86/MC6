# MC6
MC6 is a Roblox client sided exploitation gui made with the Roblox Studio editor.

## Getting Started
First you'll have to get an executor. There are some recommended executors like Fluxus, Krnl, Hydrogen, Oxygen U and Fluster Zero. Right now most executors doesn't work so I would recommend sticking with Fluxus. After getting an executor you will probably have solve some key system stuff but there are YouTube tutorials you can watch for that. You should now probably have the executor fully open. Paste the loadstring below into the editor and click Execute, you are now successfully done.

## Loadstring
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kernelcore32/MC6/main/main.lua"))()
```
